It's a multiplayer quiz application built using Java Servlets and Java Websockets. Frontend was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

The idea behind it is that the player, either registered user or not, can play a quiz provided he entered a PIN of the already started quiz that is waiting on players.

The user that starts quizes is either a registered user that can start, create, edit or delete his own quizes or is an admin who can start, edit or delete any created quiz or create new ones.

Playing a quiz is done through Websockets where the creator/admin controls the flow of the game, and players answer the given questions.
